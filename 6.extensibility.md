## Extensibility

### Plugin/Module System

YAGE is designed to be **modular from the ground up**. Every engine feature is itself a module, which means third-party developers can create their own and integrate them seamlessly.

Core characteristics of the plugin system:

* **Trait-Based Contracts:** Plugins conform to well-defined interfaces (traits), making them interchangeable with core components.
* **Cargo Integration:** Plugins are distributed as Rust crates, installable via Cargo.
* **Optional Inclusion:** No plugin is mandatory; games pull in only what they need.
* **Minimal Boilerplate:** Extending the engine should feel as natural as writing normal Rust code.

This enables a healthy ecosystem where specialized functionality (e.g., AI middleware, networking stacks, experimental renderers) can be shared and reused.

### Custom Pipelines

YAGE treats **pipelines** (asset preparation, build steps, runtime scheduling) as configurable and extendable. Developers can:

* Insert **custom asset preprocessors** (e.g., texture compression, audio normalization).
* Define **alternative scheduling policies** for ECS or task execution.
* Replace or extend build-time derivations with project-specific rules.
* Add **runtime diagnostics** or developer tools without modifying the core engine.

**Asset/Schema/Behavior Integration:** Pipeline stages may register additional **asset schemas, loaders, and validators** that bind **existing open standards** to YAGE’s ECS components—never redefining formats.

Examples:
* **Add Support For a Standard Asset Family:** (e.g., **USD**, **Rive**, **BehaviorTree JSON**).
* **Provide a Schema Validator:** Runs in the build and hot-reload loops (e.g., glTF validator, Rive JSON validation).
* **Define a Serde-Compatible Loader:** Maps structured data (e.g., glTF extras, Rive animation graphs, or behavior-tree JSON) into ECS components.
* Register a **Behavior Binding:** Connects a declared **Lua** script or **WASM** module to engine traits under capability-scoped interfaces.

This ensures YAGE can adapt to unique project requirements - from highly stylized 2D art pipelines to cutting-edge 3D rendering research.

### Lifecycle As An Extension Point

In addition to supporting core features and modular systems, YAGE exposes lifecycle management as a formal extension surface. This ensures that developers and third-party contributors can build custom behaviors, pipelines, or tools that adapt to evolving game states.

* **Lifecycle Events**
  * Plugins can register callbacks for key lifecycle events:
    * **Stage Entry/Exit:** (e.g., entering late-game, exiting tutorial).
    * **Transition Checkpoints:** (e.g., before assets are swapped, after pipelines are reconfigured).
  * Lifecycle events allow extensions to synchronize their own behavior with game progression.

* **Custom Lifecycle Definitions**
  * Developers may define entirely new lifecycle models beyond the defaults.
    * **Examples:** Roguelike runs, episodic content delivery, seasonal resets.
  * Extensions can declare new stage types and transition rules.
  * The system validates custom lifecycles for compatibility with core runtime services.

* **Pluggable Pipelines**
  * Asset and system pipelines are designed for substitution or augmentation.
  * Extensions may provide pipeline overrides for specific lifecycle stages (e.g., a custom rendering pass for an expansion).
  * Plugins can also run auxiliary pipelines in parallel (e.g., telemetry, analytics, mod integrations).

* **Extensible Asset Metadata**
  * Lifecycle metadata tags (e.g., `stage=midgame`, `stage=seasonal`) are extensible.
  * Plugins can introduce new tags for specialized workflows (e.g., `experimental`, `live-event`, `beta-test`).
  * The runtime asset manager automatically respects extended metadata definitions.

* **Toolchain Integration**
  * YAGE’s extension API allows external tools to interface with lifecycle data.
  * Examples:
    * Custom CI/CD scripts that validate stage-specific builds.
    * Modding frameworks that expose lifecycle events to community content.
    * Live ops dashboards for activating seasonal pipelines dynamically.

### Community Contributions

The long-term strength of YAGE depends on a **vibrant contributor ecosystem**. To support this, YAGE emphasizes:

* **Open standards:** favoring widely adopted file formats and APIs (e.g., glTF, WASM, Vulkan) to maximize interoperability.
* **Composable contributions:** community crates integrate without requiring forks or patches of the engine core.
* **Importer and schema crates via Cargo:** publish **importers**, **schema validators**, and **behavior bindings** as standalone crates that adapt **standard formats** to YAGE’s ECS. Favor open schemas and validators over proprietary encodings.
* **Transparent governance:** contribution guidelines, code reviews, and roadmap planning are openly documented.
* **Shared benchmarking culture:** contributors are expected to validate performance of their additions, ensuring quality remains consistent.

By making extensibility a first-class concern, YAGE can evolve rapidly without sacrificing its architectural clarity.
